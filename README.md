# Erap
ERP Framework ("Erap") is a robust starting point for building ERP systems using Django, offering reporting, dashboards, and admin elegance out of the box. Itâ€™s ideal if you want a flexible foundation. If you're looking for a plug-and-play, feature-rich ERP, you might consider alternatives like ERPNext or Odoo instead.
